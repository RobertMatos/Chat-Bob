# Chat Integrated with OpenAI's ChatGPT 🤖💬


## Objective 🚀

The "Chat Integrated with ChatGPT" project aims to develop a chat platform that allows users to engage in real-time conversations with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The main goal is to provide an interactive and efficient experience, storing conversation histories for future reference. The platform will feature a user-friendly interface, including functionalities such as chat listing, conversation opening, unwanted chat removal, and authentication for fictional users. MongoDB will be used as the database, and the implementation will be done with the Next.js framework.
